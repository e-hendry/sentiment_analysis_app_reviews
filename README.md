# sentiment_analysis_app_reviews

The purpose of this project is to develop and apply a methodology to detect negative Walmart App reviews retrieved from the Google Play Store. This project utilizes the Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word-embedding method to conduct document-based sentiment analysis to detect negative Walmart App reviews. Using the results of these methods, a best model is developed and tested on unseen reviews. The Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) method are also used to extract topics from the reviews for use in aspect-based sentiment analysis. The long-term goal of this project is to develop a system for companies to detect negative reviews in real time and identify which aspects of their products are negatively reviewed.
